		I am a software developer with experience in Rails, SQL, and Backbone.js. I have a passion for building cool stuff â€“ In my spare time I have developed web applications and games in Javascript as well as Ruby. Recently, I created a home-rental site in an effort to solidify my skills with Backbone.js, and I am currently working on a web- based storyboarding application.

		<p>
		I work well in a team-driven environment. While learning to program, I spent countless hours pair programming, and my ability to collaborate and communicate efficiently were essential to my success. Working in a fast-paced, team-oriented, environment where I can work with the best in the industry is important to me. <%= @job.blurb %>

		Attached, you will find my resume that links to my recent work along with my Github. Thank you for considering my application.
